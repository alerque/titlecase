# Scripts

Scripts for building release binaries:

* `build-all-platforms` — Build the binaries that can be compiled on the host directly.
* `build-and-tar-host` — Build and tar a binary for the host. Useful for Mac OS and OpenBSD.
* `tar-binaries` — Tar the binaries built by `bulid-all-platforms`.
* `build-freebsd` — Cross compile a FreeBSD binary in Docker.
